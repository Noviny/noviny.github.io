    {
      "name": "Win Lane, Win Game",
      "url": "https://github.com/Noviny/WinLane-WinGame",
      "screenshot": "A screenshot url in an image tag",
      "what": "Dubbed 'Project 0', this was the first project I made at General Assembly. We were tasked with building a game. After building tic-tac-toe, I decided to design my own game to digitise.",
      "why": "I have designed a number of card games in the past, and the chance to play with the components of a computer was incredibly exciting. It forced me to invent all the javascript logic myself, which made me intimately familiar with lots of data-manipulation.",
      "lesson": "This project taught me a lot on how to structure files within a project to separate concerns, and allow functions to be developed in parallel between the display and the game logic.",
      "forLater": "When I go back to this project, I want to add in a multiplayer option, which was beyond the scope of this project. With the tools I have learned since, adding a server would be relatively easy."
    },

  "bookmarksplus" :
    {
      "name": "Bookmarks+",
      "url": "https://github.com/Noviny/journal-maker",
      "screenshot": "A screenshot url in an image tag",
      "what": "This app was built for 'project 1' at GA, and allows urls to be saved by a user in to 'books', which can then be sorted by 'chapter' and allow additional details to be added.",
      "why": "I have been frustrated several times by knowing that there is great content on the internet, but I cannot share it because the archives are too dense to send someone to. This project evolved into a general-purpose way to collect and share bookmarks, to try and distill the massive internet archives.",
      "lesson": "Properly structruring your Models Viewers and Controllers can make expressing even complex relationships much easier.",
      "forLater": "I am currently working on a chrome extension for this project, to allow people to add exisitng folders swiftly from links a person has already collected and sorted."

  "moneyistime" :
    {
      "name": "Money Is Time",
      "url": "https://github.com/Noviny/money-is-time",
      "screenshot": "A screenshot url in an image tag",
      "what": "This small app allows a person to find out their hourly rate from any kind of salary, and from there discover how many minutes or hours particular purchases take to earn.",
      "why": "I made this tiny tool over the Christmas break both to try and help people think about 'value' differently and to practice javascript after a large focus on ruby.",
      "lesson": "Having a user to test your design, and give you feedback is incredibly important. Thanks to my mum for taking an interest.",
      "forLater": "This app was designed to be a very small tool and does not need its scope extended. If I wanted to practice my styling, this might be a site worth working on."
    },

  "socialview" :
    {
      "name": "Social View",
      "url": "https://github.com/Noviny/socialview",
      "screenshot": "A screenshot url in an image tag",
      "what": "'Project 2' was a group project, where I teamed up with three of my classmates to create a 'social map'",
      "why": "Learning to work in a group with other developers is key to success.",
      "lesson": "Keeping constant track of your intended scope against how much time you have to deliver can greatly relieve pressure.",
      "forLater": "Optimising how the AJAX requests are made to the two APIs, so the information can be updated live is the next major feature to work on."
    },

  "jsjargon" :
    {
      "name": "JS Jargon",
      "url": "https://github.com/Noviny/socialview",
      "screenshot": "A screenshot url in an image tag",
      "why": "There is a lot of jargon used in programming, and we should be looking for ways to make this more accessible.",
      "lesson": "This was my first time building an app in node, and this greatly enhanced my understanding of it, and gave me a strong base to compare working in node to working on rails.",
      "forLater": "Integrate the twitter streaming API."
