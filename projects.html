<div id="winlane-wingame">
  <a href="https://github.com/Noviny/WinLane-WinGame">Win Lane, Win game</a>
  <p>Screenshot goes here</p>
  <h3>Why?</h3>
  <p>As my first project at General Assembly, we were challenged to digitise a physical game. To challenge myself, I also designed a new game, which was playable with regular playing cards.</p>
  <h3>Key Lesson</h3>
  <p>This project taught me a lot on how to structure files within a project to separate concerns, and allow functions to be developed.</p>
  <h3>Further Development</h3>
  <p>When I go back to this project, I want to add in a multiplayer option, which was beyond the scope of this project.</p>

<div id="bookmarks-plus">
  <a href="https://github.com/Noviny/journal-maker">Bookmarks+</a>
  <p>Screenshot goes here</p>
  <h3>Why?</h3>
  <p>I have been frustrated several times by knowing that there is great content on the internet, but I cannot share it because the archives are too dense to send someone to. This project evolved into a general--purpose way to collect and share bookmarks, to try and distill the massive internet archives.</p>
  <h3>Key Lesson</h3>
  <p>Properly structruring your Models Viewers and Controllers can make expressing even complex relationships much easier.</p>
  <h3>Further Development</h3>
  <p>I am currently working on a chrome extension for this project, to allow people to add exisitng folders swiftly.</p>
</div>

<div id="money-is-time">
  <a href="https://github.com/Noviny/money-is-time">Money Is Time</a>
  <p>Screenshot goes here</p>
  <h3>Why?</h3>
  <p>I made this tiny tool over the Christmas break. It aims to help people see the worth of purchases in regards to how much time it took to earn it.</p>
  <h3>Key Lesson</h3>
  <p>Having a user to test your design, and give you feedback is incredibly important. Thanks to my mum for taking an interest.</p>
  <h3>Further Development</h3>
  <p>This app was designed to be a very small tool and does not need its scope extended.</p>
</div>


<div id="social-view">
  <a href="https://github.com/Noviny/socialview">Social View</a>
  <p>Screenshot goes here</p>
  <h3>Why?</h3>
  <p>Learning to work in a group with other developers is key to success.</p>
  <h3>Key Lesson</h3>
  <p>Keeping constant track of your intended scope against how much time you have to deliver can greatly relieve pressure.</p>
  <h3>Further Development</h3>
  <p>Optimising how the AJAX requests are made to the two APIs, so the information can be updated live is the next major feature to work on.</p>
</div>

<div id="js-jargon">
  <a href="https://github.com/Noviny/JS-jargon">JS Jargon</a>
  <p>Screenshot goes here</p>
  <h3>Why?</h3>
  <p>There is a lot of jargon used in programming, and we should be looking for ways to make this more accessible.</p>
  <h3>Key Lesson</h3>
  <p>This was my first time building an app in node, and this greatly enhanced my understanding of it.</p>
  <h3>Further Development</h3>
  <p>Integrate the twitter streaming API.</p>
</div>
